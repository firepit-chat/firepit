- **Direct messages and group DMs** - Private 1:1 and multi-user conversations
- **Server invites and discovery** - Invite links, public server listings, and direct join flows
- **Roles and permissions** - Per-server roles with channel overrides and moderation-aware access control
- **Messaging parity basics** - Replies, mentions, reactions, threads, pins, search, typing indicators, and file attachments
- **Profiles, presence, and social** - User profiles, statuses, friend requests, and blocking
- **Notification controls parity** - Scoped notification levels, quiet hours, mute durations, DM privacy, and bulk override management
- **Moderation and auditability** - Global and server moderation with audit log support
- **User reporting** - Report users for inappropriate profile content with admin review dashboard
- **Profile backgrounds and avatar frames** - Custom background colors, gradients, images, and seasonal/preset avatar frames
- **Custom emoji support** - Standard emoji picker plus uploaded custom emoji assets

## Codebase Features

- **User reporting and admin review** - End-user reporting plus admin triage flows in `src/components/report-user-dialog.tsx`, `src/lib/appwrite-reports.ts`, and `src/app/admin/reports/page.tsx`
- **Profiles and status** - User profile enrichment, avatars, pronouns, bios, and custom status messages
- **Profile backgrounds and avatar frames** - Appearance customization in `src/components/profile-appearance-settings.tsx`, rendering support in `src/components/profile-background.tsx`, and preset frame definitions in `src/lib/preset-frames.ts`
- **Friend system and blocking** - Social graph controls for safer private messaging
- **Notification settings and mute controls** - Consistent override behavior across servers, channels, and DMs with server-enriched labels and quiet hours

- **Production hardening** - Error boundaries, rate limiting, security validation, and observability

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun 1.2+** (Bun 1.3+ preferred for performance improvements) installed
- An **Appwrite instance** (cloud or self-hosted):
    - Cloud: [appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io) (free tier available)
    - Self-hosted: [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/firepit.git
cd firepit

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
nano .env.local  # Edit with your Appwrite credentials

# 4. Validate your configuration
bun run validate-env

# 5. Initialize the database
bun run setup

# 6. Start the development server
bun dev  # Uses Turbopack (~700x faster than Webpack)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

**Development Commands:**

- `bun dev` - Start with Turbopack (recommended, ~1.5s cold start)
- `bun dev:webpack` - Start with Webpack (fallback, ~12s cold start)
- `bun build` - Production build with Turbopack
- `bun build:webpack` - Production build with Webpack (fallback)

Dependency updates follow caret ranges in `package.json`. Use `bun run update:force` to refresh `next`, `appwrite`, and `node-appwrite` to the latest compatible releases, `bun run update:pin` to intentionally pin exact versions, and `bun run update:check` to review available updates. The old `update:exact` name was renamed to `update:pin` to make the policy clearer.

- Partial Prerendering (PPR) for instant page loads
- Aggressive caching for repeat visits (~100ms)

✅ **Monitoring & Observability**

- New Relic APM integration
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Audit logging

✅ **Testing & Quality**

- 2282 passing tests
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Strict ESLint configuration

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed production deployment instructions.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Firepit still has meaningful Discord parity gaps in a few areas:

- Richer community/server organization beyond categories, such as server templates, onboarding screens, and announcement-style surfaces, is still in progress
- Notification-center, unread-management, and digest-style attention flows are still incomplete
- Voice/video calls and screen sharing are not implemented
- Bots, slash commands, and webhooks are not implemented
- Native mobile apps are not implemented, though PWA support exists

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the complete feature roadmap.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

- `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` - Your Appwrite API endpoint
- `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` - Your Appwrite project ID
- `APPWRITE_API_KEY` - Server-side API key with full permissions
- `SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID` - Optional Appwrite user ID of the dedicated system announcement sender.
  Used for system announcement threads in DMs.
  Set this in production to the user's `$id` from Appwrite Console -> Auth -> Users.
  When unset, announcement threads are read-only.
  See DEPLOYMENT.md for details.

For a complete list and detailed explanations, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md#2-environment-configuration).

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create an Appwrite account and project** at [appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io)
2. **Generate an API key** with required scopes (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. **Configure environment variables** in `.env.local`
4. **Run validation**: `bun run validate-env`
5. **Initialize database**: `bun run setup`
6. **Start the app**: `bun dev`
7. **Create your account** in the UI
8. **Make yourself admin** by setting `APPWRITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS` in `.env.local`

For detailed instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Appwrite endpoint not configured"** - Check your `.env.local` file exists and has the correct values
- **"Project not found"** - Verify your `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` matches your Appwrite Console
- **"Missing scope" errors** - Regenerate your API key with all required permissions
- **Setup script fails** - Ensure your API key has databases, collections, attributes, and indexes permissions
- **Setup script reports an attribute limit on `notification_settings`** - Update to the latest code and rerun `bun run setup`; unread persistence now uses a dedicated `thread_reads` collection instead of adding another notification-settings attribute

For more solutions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md - Troubleshooting](./DEPLOYMENT.md#troubleshooting).

## 🧪 Testing

This project maintains a comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run tests with coverage report
bun run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode (during development)
bun run test --watch
```

Current test coverage: **49.86%** lines (growing, **34951/70089**)

- 2282 tests passing across 204 test suites
- Comprehensive API route testing
- Focus on security-critical modules (auth, roles, moderation), and modules critical for function (API routes, hooks, utility files, etc.)

## 📦 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables from `.env.local`
4. Deploy!

### Self-Hosted

```bash
# Build the application
bun build

# Start production server
bun start
```
