## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18+ or **Bun** installed
- **Appwrite** instance (cloud or self-hosted)
    - Cloud: Sign up at [https://appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io)
    - Self-hosted: Follow [Appwrite Installation](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

---

## Quick Start

For experienced users who want to get running fast:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/acarlson33/firepit.git
cd firepit
bun install

# 2. Configure Appwrite
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Appwrite credentials

# 3. Bootstrap database
bun run setup

# 4. Start development server
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create your first account!

---

## Detailed Setup

### 1. Appwrite Setup

#### A. Create Appwrite Project

1. Log into your Appwrite Console
2. Click **"Create Project"**
3. Name it (e.g., "Firepit Chat")
4. Note your **Project ID** - you'll need this!

#### B. Create API Key

The setup script needs an API key with full permissions:

1. In Appwrite Console, go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name: `Firepit Setup Key`
4. **Scopes Required:**
    - `databases.read` and `databases.write`
    - `collections.read` and `collections.write`
    - `attributes.read` and `attributes.write`
    - `indexes.read` and `indexes.write`
    - `teams.read` and `teams.write` (unless using `SKIP_TEAMS=true`)
5. **Expiration:** Set to "Never" or a long duration
6. Copy the API key immediately - you won't see it again!

#### C. Configure Authentication

1. Go to **Auth → Settings**
2. Enable your preferred auth methods:
    - **Email/Password** (recommended for getting started)
    - OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
3. Set **Session Length** as desired (default: 365 days)

---

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### A. Copy Example File

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

#### B. Edit `.env.local`

Open `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
# === REQUIRED: Appwrite Connection ===
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
# ☝️ Use your Appwrite Cloud region or self-hosted URL

APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
# ☝️ From Step 1A - find this in Appwrite Console

APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
# ☝️ From Step 1B - the full API key you just created

# System announcement sender account (production recommended)
SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID=your-system-sender-user-id
# ☝️ Set to the Appwrite user ID used for system announcement DMs.
# If omitted, system announcement threads are read-only for all users.

# === OPTIONAL: Collection IDs ===
# Leave these with default values - setup script will create them
# Only change if you have existing collections to use

APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=main
APPWRITE_SERVERS_COLLECTION_ID=servers
APPWRITE_CHANNELS_COLLECTION_ID=channels
APPWRITE_MESSAGES_COLLECTION_ID=messages
APPWRITE_NOTIFICATION_SETTINGS_COLLECTION_ID=notification_settings
APPWRITE_THREAD_READS_COLLECTION_ID=thread_reads
# ... (more collections with defaults)

# === OPTIONAL: Admin & Moderator Setup ===
# You can bootstrap admins two ways:
# 1. By User ID (before teams exist)
# 2. By Team ID (after running setup script)

# Method 1: Bootstrap by User IDs
# Visit /api/me after creating your first account to get your user ID
APPWRITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS=your-user-id-here
APPWRITE_MODERATOR_USER_IDS=

# Method 2: Bootstrap by Team IDs
# The setup script creates these teams automatically
# After setup, add users to teams via Appwrite Console
APPWRITE_ADMIN_TEAM_ID=
APPWRITE_MODERATOR_TEAM_ID=
```

#### C. System Announcement Sender Account (Production Recommended)

`SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID` should point to a dedicated non-human Appwrite user account used only for automated announcement delivery.

How to get the value:

1. In Appwrite Console, open **Auth -> Users**.
2. Click **Create User**, enter a valid email (for example, `system+sender@yourdomain.com`) and a strong password that satisfies Appwrite requirements.
3. Mark the email as verified in Appwrite (or complete your verification flow) so the account can send system messages.
4. Do not add this account to special teams unless your deployment explicitly needs team-scoped permissions.
5. Copy the created user's `$id` and set it as `SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID`.

Why this matters:

- System announcement threads can be safely identified and treated as read-only for recipients.
- Interactive sign-in blocking is enforced by Firepit auth logic when `SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID` is set (see `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` and `src/lib/auth-server.ts`); Appwrite does not auto-disable login for that user, so use Appwrite Console (**Auth -> Users**) only if you also want to manually restrict the account there.
- If this variable is unset, Firepit defaults to read-only behavior for all system announcement threads.

#### D. Validation

Validate your configuration:

```bash
bun run validate-env
```

If you see any errors, double-check your `.env.local` values.

---

### 3. Database Initialization

Run the automated setup script to create all necessary database structures:

```bash
bun run setup
```

**What this does:**

- ✅ Creates `main` database (if it doesn't exist)
- ✅ Creates all collections (servers, channels, messages, profiles, etc.)
- ✅ Creates dedicated unread persistence storage in `thread_reads` without consuming another `notification_settings` attribute slot
- ✅ Ensures `setupThreadReads` configures `thread_reads.reads` with the large text limit (~65KB, roughly ~1000 thread entries per context)
- ✅ Sets up attributes with proper types and sizes
- ✅ Creates indexes for query performance
- ✅ Configures storage buckets (avatars)
- ✅ Creates admin and moderator teams
- ✅ Validates API key permissions

**Output:** You should see:

```
[INFO] Checking database 'main'...
[INFO] Database exists.
[INFO] Checking collection 'servers'...
[INFO] Collection exists.
...
[INFO] Setup complete.
```

**Common Issues:**

- **"Missing scopes"**: Your API key needs more permissions (see Step 1B)
- **"Project not found"**: Double-check your `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
- **"Unauthorized"**: Verify your `APPWRITE_API_KEY` is correct

### 4. Initial Deployment

#### Development Server

```bash
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Create Your First Account

1. Click **"Sign Up"** or **"Login"**
2. Register with email and password
3. You're in!

#### Make Yourself Admin (Optional)

**Method 1: Using User ID Bootstrap**

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/api/me](http://localhost:3000/api/me)
2. Copy your `$id` from the JSON response
3. Add it to `.env.local`:
    ```bash
    APPWRITE_ADMIN_USER_IDS=your-copied-user-id
    ```
4. Restart the dev server
5. Visit [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to verify

**Method 2: Using Teams**

1. Go to Appwrite Console → Auth → Teams
2. Find "Admins" team (created by setup script)
3. Click team → Memberships → Add Member
4. Enter your email or user ID
5. Refresh your app - you're now an admin!

## Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
    - All `APPWRITE_*` variables
    - `APPWRITE_API_KEY` (mark as sensitive!)
4. Deploy!

### Self-Hosted Deployment

```bash
# Build production bundle
bun run build

# Start production server
bun start
```

**Environment Variables:**

- Set all variables from `.env.local` in your hosting environment
- Use secrets management for `APPWRITE_API_KEY`
- Ensure `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` points to your production Appwrite
- Set `SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID` to the dedicated Appwrite system-sender user `$id` in production
- `SYSTEM_SENDER_USER_ID` controls interactive sign-in blocking and system-thread read-only behavior in `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts` and `src/lib/auth-server.ts`

**Reverse Proxy Setup (Nginx):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Appwrite endpoint not configured"

**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded properly, or not available at runtime in deployed environments

**Fix:**

**For local development:**

```bash
# Verify .env.local exists
ls -la .env.local

# Check values are set
grep APPWRITE .env.local

# Restart dev server
bun dev
```

**For deployed environments (Vercel, Appwrite, etc.):**

Environment variables are now automatically exposed at runtime through the Next.js configuration. Ensure that:

1. All required environment variables are set in your deployment platform's environment settings
2. The variables include at minimum:
    - `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` - Your Appwrite API endpoint
    - `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` - Your Appwrite project ID
    - `APPWRITE_API_KEY` - Your server-side API key
3. After setting environment variables, redeploy your application for changes to take effect

The application will automatically load these variables at runtime without requiring the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, keeping your configuration secure and server-side only.

### "The current user is not authorized"

**Cause:** User not authenticated or lacks permissions

**Fix:**

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check user has necessary role (admin/moderator)
3. Verify team memberships in Appwrite Console
4. Review collection permissions in Appwrite Console

### Setup Script Fails with "Missing scopes"

**Cause:** API key lacks required permissions

**Fix:**

1. Go to Appwrite Console → Settings → API Keys
2. Delete old key
3. Create new key with ALL scopes from Step 1B
4. Update `APPWRITE_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
5. Re-run `bun run setup`

### Database Already Exists But Script Fails

**Cause:** Partial setup from previous failed run

**Fix:**

1. The script is idempotent - just re-run it
2. It will skip existing resources and create missing ones
3. Safe to run multiple times

### Setup Script Fails with Notification Settings Attribute Limit

**Cause:** An older checkout tried to add unread persistence directly to the `notification_settings` schema, which can exceed Appwrite's attribute limit on some projects.

**Fix:**

1. Pull the latest version of this branch
2. Ensure `.env.local` includes `APPWRITE_THREAD_READS_COLLECTION_ID=thread_reads`
3. Re-run `bun run setup`
4. Confirm the setup creates or reuses the dedicated `thread_reads` collection instead of trying to add `notification_settings.threadReadStates`
5. Monitor `thread_reads.reads` utilization per context and alert when payload size approaches the configured limit (for example, at 80%+ of the attribute size)

No manual data migration is required for existing notification-settings documents.

### "Cannot find module" errors

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed

**Fix:**

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
bun install

# Verify Bun version (need 1.0+)
bun --version
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use

**Fix:**

```bash
# Use different port
PORT=3001 bun dev

# Or kill existing process
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```
